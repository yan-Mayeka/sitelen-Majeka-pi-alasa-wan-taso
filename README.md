sitelen Majeka pi alasa wan taso (Just-one-attempt Majeka-glyphs) is a ligature and UCSUR compliant font for Sitelen Pona.
It includes a newly made ligature system which fixes þe SP kangaroo problem, whenin "toki" becomes "t󱥄k" (sitelen pona "o"), "alasa" becomes "󱤂s"(sitelen pona "ala"), etc., before þe last letter is typed to complete þe ligature.

(Þe ligs do not require a space to complete)

It also includes þe nimisin: owe, su, isipin, and pokasi.
It also includes þe Majeka/muun name glyph for jan Majeka, aswell as ligatures for meli+awen, jan+e, and ko+ale.

Þe main feature is all of þe glyphs are my first time drawing þem for þis font.
